# In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False,
# except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "",
# the number 0, and the value None.
# And of course the value False evaluates to False.

# The following will return False:
bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})
