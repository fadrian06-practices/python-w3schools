# Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

# Parentheses has the highest precedence,
# meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

# Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +,
# and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:
print(100 + 5 * 3)
