# You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.

# Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

# Print all items by referring to their index number:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
    print(thislist[i])

# The iterable created in the example above is [0, 1, 2].
